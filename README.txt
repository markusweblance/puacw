Ajax Shopping Cart for Woocommerce in pop-up.

== Description ==
This plugin adds an Ajax Pop-Up cart to your store. Must be used in conjunction with Woocommece.

Add **[puacw_basket_counter]** shortcode in the editor or **echo do_shortcode ('[puacw_basket_counter]')** in your theme templates. The shortcode displays the text **"Cart"** with a counter of products, by clicking on which a Pop-Up with products will open.

In the window, you can change the quantity of each item, as well as delete items added to the cart. There is a display of the total amount of purchases and a button to go to checkout.

There is an opportunity to customize some elements of the Pop-Up window.
